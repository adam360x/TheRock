"""Runs the JAX test suite against installed JAX ROCm wheels.

The suite scripts in the ROCm/jax checkout stay the source of truth for how the
tests run: ci/run_pytest_rocm.sh for a whole run, and ci/run_pytest_rocm_multi.sh
for the multi-accelerator subset on its own. This adds only what is ours:

  * the ROCm runtime workarounds this repository needs;
  * the known-bad tests from skip_tests/, as a pytest -k expression;
  * an optional --test-list, described under "Selecting a subset" below;
  * two layers of retry, described under "Retries" below;
  * holding the run to the CPUs the pod was given, described under "Resources".

Nothing the suite decides is repeated here. Its environment is read back out of
it, so a version that changes its allocator or its XLA flags, including behind a
conditional, needs no change in this file. Reading it is required rather than
best-effort: the retry pass decides the result, so running it under a different
environment than the suite would make that verdict meaningless. A checkout it
cannot be read from fails the run with an error naming what to update.

Retries
-------

--in-process-reruns is pytest-rerunfailures: it repeats a failed test in the same
worker, recovering a crashed worker or a one-off runtime error.

--fresh-process-retry re-runs the reported failures in a new process, and decides
the result. It is not interchangeable with the above: a sticky failure leaves the
process failing every later test the same way, which no rerun inside it can
clear. It only speaks for the suite when the suite's own pytest sessions ran to
the end, which their reported exit codes are what say.

--no-retries turns off both, running the suite exactly as the script does.

Selecting a subset
------------------

--test-list names a file of test paths to run instead of the whole suite, which
is how CI gets a PR-sized run out of the same suite the nightly runs. It is
applied by ignoring everything under tests/ the list does not name, rather than
by passing the list to pytest, so that the suite script still decides how the
tests run. -k would leave the modules left out imported anyway, and importing
them is most of what a short run has time for.

Resources
---------

A container shares the host's kernel, so nothing a process can query describes
the container: on the gfx942 runners a job holding 25 cores of an 8-way shared
box reads 192 cores and 2268 GiB, and sizes every thread pool from that. What
the pod actually got arrives in KUBE_CPU_REQUEST, and --cpus says the same thing
on a machine that has no CI runner to inject it.

The run is pinned to that many CPUs, which the suite and the retry pass inherit.
Measured on a gfx942 runner, one worker holds 1021 threads unpinned and 107
pinned to 25 cores with OpenBLAS capped, against 16 workers at a time.

Example usage:

    # As CI runs it.
    python run_jax_tests.py --jax-dir jax --jax-ref rocm-jaxlib-v0.11.0 \\
        --amdgpu-family gfx94X-dcgpu

    # The suite with both retry layers off.
    python run_jax_tests.py --jax-dir jax --no-retries

    # Print the environment and commands without running anything.
    python run_jax_tests.py --jax-dir jax --jax-version 0.10.2 --dry-run

    # Run only the tests the skip list would have skipped.
    python run_jax_tests.py --jax-dir jax --jax-version 0.10.2 --debug

    # The subset PR CI runs.
    python run_jax_tests.py --jax-dir jax \\
