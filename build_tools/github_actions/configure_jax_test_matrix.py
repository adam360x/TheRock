"""Configure JAX wheel test jobs for a GPU family.

The suite splits in two by the "multiaccelerator" pytest marker. Only that
subset needs more than one GPU, and it is a small part of the run, so the two go
to different runners: the family's 1-GPU runner takes the suite, which on one
GPU is the single-accelerator tests, and its multi-GPU runner takes the
multi-accelerator script.

Multi-GPU runners are scarce, so the second job is only worth its queue slot
when full testing is asked for. Short testing, which is what a pull request
gets, runs the suite on the 1-GPU runner alone.
